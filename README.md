Builds on Next.JS's starter blog using TypeScript by adding support for LaTeX-style processing in markdown files.

## Apple M1 Chip

As of 7/1/2021, I can only run NextJS apps on my MacBook with an M1 chip by using certain versions of Node. Currently I'm developing with 15.3.0, which isn't ideal. Hopefully the bug will be fixed by the time anyone finds and needs this!
