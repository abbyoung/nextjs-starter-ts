## Lift Coefficient

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following equation.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$

## Pythagorean Theorem

The well known Pythagorean theorem $(x^2 + y^2 = z^2)$ was
proved to be invalid for other exponents.
Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions:

$$
x^n + y^n = z^n
$$

## Mass-Energy Equivalence

The mass-energy equivalence is described by the famous equation

$$
E=mc^2
$$

discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.
In natural units ($c$ = 1), the formula expresses the identity

$$
E=m
$$
